# GardenGlory-With-Django
Making an inventory and transaction archive using python and django framework

This is similar to garden glory project with WPF but instead of using WPF I used django framework and switched the programming language to python

*it is important to note that this project isn't completely finish and I intend to finish it as soon as I get some free time as I entend to continue this kinds of projects as a hobby to further my understanding of web frameworks
